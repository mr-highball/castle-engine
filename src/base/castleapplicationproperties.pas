    { Application short name.
      Used e.g. by @link(InitializeLog) to name the log file.

      When compiled with FPC, this returns and sets the same thing
      as standard SysUtils.ApplicationName.
      When setting this, we automatically set SysUtils.OnGetApplicationName. }
    property ApplicationName: string read GetApplicationName write SetApplicationName;

    { Version of this application.
      It may be used e.g. by @link(InitializeLog) and
      @link(TCastleApplication.ParseStandardParameters). }
    property Version: string read FVersion write FVersion;

    { Initialized to @true on touch devices (Android, iOS).

      A "touch device" means that:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(We cannot track @link(TUIContainer.MousePosition)
          when nothing is pressed (@link(TUIContainer.MousePressed) is [])
          on a touch device.)

        @item(The only "mouse button" you will ever see pressed
          on a touch device is mbLeft.)

        @item(On the other hand, touch devices support multitouch, exposed by
          @link(TUIContainer.Touches) and @link(TUIContainer.TouchesCount).
          On touch devices, @link(TUIContainer.TouchesCount) can range
          from 0 to a few (modern touch devices support up to 5 simultaneous
          touches).

          On non-touch devices, @link(TUIContainer.TouchesCount) is always 1.)
      )

      As a debugging feature, you can set this to @true
      to simulate touch devices on a desktop.
      The idea is that when an application shows a different input behaviour
      on touch devices, it should always condition it depending on
      this boolean property. So an application may do this:

      @longCode(#
      Window.AutomaticTouchInterface := ApplicationProperties.TouchDevice;
      Window.ScenaManager.WalkCamera.MouseLook := not ApplicationProperties.TouchDevice;
      #)

      And to test on desktop whether everything behaves OK on mobile,
      you can just earlier call this:

      @longCode(#
      if FakeTouchDeviceOnDesktop then
        ApplicationProperties.TouchDevice := true;
      #)
    }
    property TouchDevice: boolean read FTouchDevice write FTouchDevice;

    { Limit the number of (real) frames per second, to not hog the CPU.
      Set to zero to not limit.

      The mechanism is implemented by occasionally sleeping
      (when we see that we render way faster than we need to).
      So it's a global thing, not just a property of TCastleWindow or TCastleControl.

      In some cases, this also means the "desired number of FPS".
      This happens when we may be clogged with events
      (which is especially possible in case of mouse look,
      when we use CastleControl, or when we use CastleWindow with LCL backend).
      In such cases we try hard to call "update" and (if necessary) "render"
      events at least as often as LimitFPS.
      When LimitFPS is used for this purpose ("desired number of FPS, not just a limit"),
      it is also capped (by 100.0).

      @unorderedList(
        @item(Comments specifically about CastleWindow:

          To be more precise, this limits the number of TCastleApplication.ProcessMessage
          calls per second, in situations when we do not have to process any user input.
          So we limit not only rendering (TCastleWindowBase.OnRender)
          but also other animation processing (TCastleWindowBase.OnUpdate) calls per second.
          See TCastleApplication.ProcessMessage.

          See TCastleWindow.ProcessMessage documentation about WaitToLimitFPS
          parameter, and see TCastleApplication.LimitFPS documentation.)

        @item(Comments specifically about CastleControl:

          This mechanism is activated only when some TCastleControl
          component is used, and only when LCL idle is fired (so we have no pending
          events, as LCL idle is "lazy" and fires only when process is really idle),
          and not at Lazarus design time.)
      )
    }
    property LimitFPS: Single read FLimitFPS write FLimitFPS default DefaultLimitFPS;

    { Callbacks called when the OpenGL context is opened or closed.
      Use when you want to be notified about OpenGL context availability,
      but cannot refer to a particular instance of TCastleControl or TCastleWindow.

      Note that we may have many OpenGL contexts (many
      TCastleWindow or TCastleControl instances) open simultaneously.
      They all share OpenGL resources.
      OnGLContextOpen is called when first OpenGL context is open,
      that is: no previous context was open.
      OnGLContextClose is called when last OpenGL context is closed,
      that is: no more contexts remain open.
      Note that this implies that they may be called many times:
      e.g. if you open one window, then close it, then open another
      window then close it.

      Callbacks on OnGLContextOpen are called from first to last.
      Callbacks on OnGLContextClose are called in reverse order,
      so OnGLContextClose[0] is called last.

      You can use this just like @link(TCastleControlBase.OnUpdate)
      or @link(TCastleWindowBase.OnUpdate) or @link(TCastleApplication.OnUpdate),
      but in situations where you cannot access an instance of control/window
      and you want to work both with Lazarus @link(TCastleControl)
      and our custom @link(TCastleApplication). }
    property OnUpdate: TNotifyEventList read FOnUpdate;

    { Callbacks called when Android Java activity started.
      Called every time a Java activity is created.

      @unorderedList(
        @item(For the first time, it's called right before
          @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize).)

        @item(Later this is called when Java activity
          died (and is restarting now), but the native code thread survived.
          So all native code memory is already cool (no need to call
          @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize)),
          but we need to reinitialize Java part.

          Note that this is different from @link(TCastleWindowBase.OnOpen).
          We lose OpenGL context often, actually every time user switches to another
          app, without having neither Java nor native threads killed.
        )
      )

      For non-Android applications, this is simply always called exactly
      once, exactly before calling @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize). }

      consider these events somewhat internal for the time being.

      In case of CastleWindow:
      On Android, opening files before Android application started (on the Java side)
      is not possible.
      On iOS, some things (like ApplicationConfig path) may not be initialized so early. }
